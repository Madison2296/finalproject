I am interested in the evolution of birds after the KT extinction.
I plan to use data from the PBDB to explore fossil occurances of birds.
I will need to analyze and quantify data regarding the location and age of these fossils.
I will then need to visually present this data.

Groups:
1. falconiforme, 287 unique species
2. pelecaniform, 268 unique species
3. charadriiform, 691 unique species

shell command
tail -n +17 $1|cut -d ',' -f 6-7|grep -n "species"|sort -d|uniq|wc -l 
with $1 representing the file name
