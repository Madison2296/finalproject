I am interested in the evolution of birds after the KT extinction.
I plan to use data from the PBDB to explore fossil occurances of birds.
I will need to analyze and quantify data regarding the location and age of these fossils.
I will then need to visually present this data.

tail -n +17 $1|cut -f 6-7|grep -n "species"|uniq -c
