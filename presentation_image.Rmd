# The Main Question:

### How do fossil records of birds compare to that of mammals?

By comparing fossil timelines, extinction and speciation rates, and fossil locations we can better understand how the two groups may interact.

## The Question for Today:

#### How can we visualize the locations of the fossils while comparing birds and mammals?

We are working with a csv file that includes a header and a multitude of variables

We will need to take our data file, remove the header, extract our relevant data, and rewrite this data to a new file

We will do this twice. Once for the bird data and once for the mammal data

Unix code to reamove the header:
tail -n +19 filename > cleaned_filename

This is the function we will use in python

```
def locations(openfile, writefile):
    newfile = openfile
    output = open(writefile, "w")
    with open(newfile, 'r') as ff:
        readfile = ff.readlines() # open and read file
    for line in readfile: #go through each line
        taxon = line.split(",")[9]
        if taxon == '"species"': #only continue if the line contains a species
            species = line.split(",")[8].replace('"','') #extract species names
            genus = species.split(" ")[0] #extract genus name
            lat = line.split(",")[18].replace('"','') #extract latitude
            lng = line.split(",")[17].replace('"','') #extract longitude
            outline = "{},{},{}\n".format(genus,lat,lng)
            output.write(outline) #write data to the file
    output.close()
```
#### Time to make a map

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(maps)
library(mapdata)
bird_locations <- read.csv("/home/eeb177-student/Desktop/eeb-177/eeb-177-final-project/aves_genus_locations.csv", header = F, as.is = T)
names(bird_locations) <- c("genus", "latitude", "longitude")
mammal_locations <- read.csv("/home/eeb177-student/Desktop/eeb-177/eeb-177-final-project/mammal_genus_locations.csv")
names(mammal_locations) <- c("genus", "latitude", "longitude")
fossil_locations <- ggplot() + geom_point(data = bird_locations, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), col = adjustcolor("yellow", alpha = 1)) + geom_point(data = mammal_locations, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), col = adjustcolor("red", alpha = 0.1))
world <- map_data("world")
fossil_locations <- fossil_locations + geom_polygon(data = world, aes(x=long, y=lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = "black") + coord_fixed(1.3)
fossil_locations <- fossil_locations + ggtitle("Fossil Occurences of Aves and Mammals")
fossil_locations
```
